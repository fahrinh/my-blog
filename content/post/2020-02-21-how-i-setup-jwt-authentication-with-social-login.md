These are questions come to my mind when I want to setup authentication of API for the first time:

- JWT vs OAuth2 ? Which more secure ? Which more simple to setup ?
- Where is the safest place to store token in browser ? Localstorage ? Cookies ?
- If cookies is chosen, how about mobile apps or another client that want to access your API ? Is it convenient enough ?
